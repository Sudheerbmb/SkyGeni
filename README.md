### 3. **What was the average inflation rate when subscriptions were renewed?**

To find the average inflation rate during subscription renewals, we merged the `subscription_information.csv` dataset with `finanical_information.csv` on the `start_date` field. By filtering for records where the subscription was renewed, we computed the mean of the `inflation_rate` field to provide the answer.

### 4. **What is the median amount paid each year for all payment methods?**

We calculated the median amount paid each year by analyzing the `payment_information.csv` dataset. The `payment_date` field was converted to a datetime format, and we grouped the data by year and payment method. The median amount paid was computed for each combination of year and payment method.
